1. Initialize data extraction by receiving the input variables: review (text of the review), name (reviewer's name), location (reviewer's location), and date (date of the review).  

2. Analyze the content of the review by:  
   a. Identifying sentiment through natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Focus on detecting positive, negative, or neutral sentiments expressed in the review.  
   b. Assessing the presence of specific keywords or phrases that typically correlate with ratings, such as 'excellent,' 'good,' 'average,' 'poor,' or 'terrible'.  

3. Evaluating the rating based on the following criteria:  
   a. If the sentiment is predominantly positive and keywords indicate high satisfaction, assign a rating of 4 or 5 stars.  
   b. If the sentiment is neutral or mixed, or if keywords suggest moderate satisfaction, assign a rating of 3 stars.  
   c. If the sentiment is predominantly negative and keywords indicate dissatisfaction, assign a rating of 1 or 2 stars.  

4. Output the determined rating along with a brief justification based on the sentiment analysis and keyword assessment.  

5. Ensure the analysis is repeatable and consistent by documenting any patterns or weighting of keywords and sentiments that influence the rating.
