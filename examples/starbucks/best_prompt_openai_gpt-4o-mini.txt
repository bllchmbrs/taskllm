2. Identify specific phrases or keywords that indicate the reviewer's feelings, such as positive words (e.g., excellent, love, great) or negative words (e.g., terrible, hate, bad).
3. Consider the rating scale you will use (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) and how the review content aligns with this scale:
   - A review expressing very positive feelings (enthusiastic comments) should be rated closer to the maximum score.
   - A neutral review with mixed comments may receive a middle score.
   - A review with predominantly negative sentiments should receive a lower score.
4. After analyzing the sentiment and specific comments, assign a numerical rating based on the interpretation of the overall feedback.
5. Summarize your reasoning briefly to explain why a particular rating was assigned, citing specific parts of the review that influenced your decision.
