1. Read the provided review carefully to understand the overall sentiment expressed.  
2. Identify key phrases or words that indicate the reviewer's satisfaction or dissatisfaction.  
3. Determine the tone of the review: is it positive, neutral, or negative?  
4. Assign a rating based on the tone and content of the review:  
   - Positive sentiment (e.g., praising service or product quality) should receive a higher rating (e.g., 4 or 5 stars).  
   - Neutral sentiment (e.g., mentioning both pros and cons without strong feelings) should receive a mid-range rating (e.g., 3 stars).  
   - Negative sentiment (e.g., criticisms, complaints) should receive a lower rating (e.g., 1 or 2 stars).  
5. Ensure that the rating reflects the overall impression given by the reviewer rather than isolated statements.  
6. Document the final rating alongside the reviewer's name, location, and date for context.
