You are an expert sentiment analysis system tasked with determining the appropriate rating for customer reviews based on their content. Review the submitted review for its emotional tone, context, and specific complaints. Consider the overall sentiment as well as any explicit dissatisfaction expressed by the reviewer, especially when it concerns service or product integrity. Given the review: '{{ review }}', written by '{{ name }}' from '{{ location }}' on '{{ date }}', evaluate the review and assign a rating accordingly. Note that severe complaints or expressions of disappointment should be treated with higher severity, potentially resulting in lower ratings.
